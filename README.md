# Crodfunding Campaign Sound Monitor

This is a very simple ruby script that monitors a certain URL of a crowdfunding campaign page that has the raised sum visbile. The monitor plays a sound whenever it spots that the money amount has increased, and multiple sounds if the amount has increased a lot.

The script works with Invesdor crowdfunding using EUR just by changing the URL, but for other platforms the code needs modifying.
